<title>Overview</title>

<p>Every volunteer project obtains its strength from the people involved in it. We invite you to participate as much or as little as you choose. The roles and responsibilities that people can assume in the project are based on merit. Everybody's input matters!</p>

<p>There are a variety of ways to participate. Regardless of how you choose to participate, we suggest you join some or all of our <a href="mail.html">mailing lists</a>.</p>

<p><b>Use the Products and Give Us Feedback</b></p>
